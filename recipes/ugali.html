        <h2>What's Ugali? (fom ni kusembeka...)</h3>
        <p>Ugali is like a porridge but much more dense made from white maize meal or maize flour.</p>
        <p>It is the staple diet of the indigenous people of East Africa. </p>
        <p>Ugali is also served with nyama choma which is grilled meat and kachumbari, a tomato onion salad. </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of maize meal or corn meal</li>
            <li>2 cups of water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat water over medium heat in a deep pan. Make sure you take a pan with a handle.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle about 1 tbsp of the maize meal while the water comes to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add the maize meal or cornmeal and keep on stirring with a strong wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Keep stirring and pressing the mixture against the sides of the pan to break up the lumps.</li>
            <li>As the mixture becomes thicker, it becomes more difficult to mix but keep mixing and breaking up the lumps.</li>
            <li>The mixture with begin to come away from the sides of the pan.</li>
            <li>Allow it to cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>At this point either transfer the ugali to a platter from the pan. Place the plate over the pan and turn it upside down.</li>
            <li>Or you can transfer to a small heatproof bowl. Pat it down into shape. Place a plate over the bowl and turn it over.</li>
            <li>Enjoy piping hot ugali with your favourite stew or curry.</li>
        </ol>
