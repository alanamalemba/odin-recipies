        <h2>What's Ugali? (fom ni kusembeka...)</h3>
        <p>Ugali is like a porridge but much more dense made from white maize meal or maize flour.</p>
        <p>It is the staple diet of the indigenous people of East Africa. </p>
        <p>Ugali is also served with nyama choma which is grilled meat and kachumbari, a tomato onion salad. </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of maize meal or corn meal</li>
